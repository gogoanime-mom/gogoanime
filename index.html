	<h1>The Most Stoic Anime Characters - Gogoanime</h1>

<div class="container">
<p>The most eccentric and rowdy characters of fiction can be found in anime on <a href="https://gogoanime.mom/">Gogoanime</a> website. However, the same applies to emotionally and mentally withdrawn people.</p>
<p>It's not possible for everyone to be as big as Luffy in One Piece or as intense as Goku in <em>Dragon Ball</em>. That's okay.</p>
<p>Characters whose expressions are remarkably unchanged in the face tragedy or euphoria can be quite captivating.</p>
<p>What are the characters who seem most disconnected and yet manage to keep the show interesting for viewers?</p>
<h3>Yakumo Tsukamoto</h3>
<p><strong>Anime:</strong> Schools Rumble</p>
<p>School Rumble had 54 episodes. It felt like it could have lasted five more seasons.</p>
<p>It boasts one of the most impressive teen casts in anime. A charming kuudere-MC like Yakumo Tsukamoto can be hard to find.</p>
<p>Her main love story is between Tenma Karasuma, her younger sister, and Ooji Karasuma.</p>
<p>You can't help but feel for her as she falls for Kenji Harima slowly, but surely.</p>
<p>She is hesitant about romantic pursuits, as Harima is obsessed with Tenma.</p>
<p>Yakumo is a bright side. She doesn't need to be praised by a man.</p>
<p>Many fans regard her as the No. One of the most popular 'traditional' housewives/waifu on the show.</p>
<p>Yakumo is gentle and intelligent. She cares for her younger sister and keeps the house clean.</p>
<h3>Ais Wallenstein</h3>
<p><strong>Anime</strong> Is it wrong to try to pick up girls in a dungeon?</p>
<p>Ais Wallenstein demonstrates that not all elite members are determined to prevent the development of others in Dungeon.</p>
<p>Ais isn't like other first-class adventurers. She doesn't ridicule weaker adventurers and is considered the strongest member of her division.</p>
<p>It's no wonder that she is blessed with beauty and strength, from her long and lustrous locks and her golden eyes to her elegant figure.</p>
<p>Ais is often silent, so she can be dressed in either heavy armor or pretty white dresses.</p>
<p>But this is not about being emotionally detached for the sake.</p>
<p>Ais requires more practice and time in verbal expression.</p>
<p>If everyone could only see her mind, they would know that Ais can be very childlike and extra-adorable.</p>
<h3>Mikasa Ackerman</h3>
<p><strong>Anime:</strong> Attack on Titan</p>
<p>Mikasa Ackerman: What more can you say?</p>
<p>She is one of three MCs for the greatest success story in anime of the 2010s. The fourth and final AoT seasons once again brought the series into the public's eye.</p>
<p>Mikasa is not without her emotions, from anger to despair and sorrow, but her unbothered facial expression has made her a favourite.</p>
<p>Mikasa is among the smartest and strongest of her batch. Her face is not full of arrogance or embarrassment.</p>
<p>Mikasa wished to live peacefully and not venture beyond the walls. She grew up with Eren, Armin, but most importantly Eren.</p>
<p>When she was young, she was more cheerful and easygoing than ever before.</p>
<p><em>Shingeki to Kyojin</em>, however, is anything but peaceful.</p>
<p>She doesn't want to be forgotten by her family and joins Eren in military service. There, she meets the terrors of titans as well as humanity.</p>
<p>The expression of a Titan is not usually changed by her.</p>
<p>However, the sight of a loved-one in danger can cause her to lose her cool but not her deadly combat skills.</p>

<h3>Jun Satou</h3>
<p><strong>Animation:</strong> Working !</p>
<p>The series' key chef, a 20-year old Wagnaria family restaurant head chef, is critical to its success:</p>
<p>He is arguably the one who ensures that this workplace comedy's "work" aspect is kept alive for three seasons.</p>
<p>Satou's devotion to his work isn’t the only thing that distinguishes him.</p>
<p>He's not going to scold the other employees for being silly. Instead, he worries about how he can finally admit his love for Yachiyo Torodoki.</p>
<p>Yachiyo, a 28-year-old restaurant manger, is obsessed with Kyouko Shirafuji.</p>
<p>What's the worst thing for him?</p>
<p>Satou often hears her tell Satou about her love for Kyouko.</p>
<p>This is a sharp arrow that goes right into his <em>Kokoro</em> every single time.</p>
<p>His work ethic and his helpful nature are unmatched by his romantic dreams.</p>
<p>Satou's expression is not much different. He's an attentive listener.</p>
<p>He cooks and takes orders, while others vent frustrations and worries. And he will offer solid advice at the end.</p>
<p>Satou, you deserve all the love and smoke breaks.</p>
<h3>Kanade Tachibana</h3>
<p><strong>Anime:</strong> Angel Beats!</p>
<p><em>Angel Beats</em> shows that anime fans don't need to understand the show in its entirety (or have 24 episodes).</p>
<p>Kanade Tachibana, also known as Angel in Japan, was the boss of the Jun Maeda original series.</p>
<p>Otonashi, Yuri Nakamura and the rest on the Afterlife Battlefront trembled at her sight in battle.</p>
<p>She was able to withstand injuries and use her superhuman abilities.</p>
<p>Soon, viewers saw that Kanade wasn't evil.</p>
<p>She is passionate about taking care of the garden and was once a member.</p>
<p>Most importantly, for all her calm moments, she is the key to one show's most memorable moments - an ending viewers will never forget.</p>
<h3>Kanna Kamui</h3>
<p><strong>Anime</strong> Miss Kobayashi’s Dragon Maid</p>
<p>After the tragic arson incident that killed Kyoto Animation, Kyoto Animation is now back in TV anime. Everyone welcomed the second season <em>Kobayashi san Chi no maid Dragon</em>.</p>
<p>Each character is carefully drawn and animated to show nuances of their personalities. Kanna Kamui will probably remain the cutest anime dragon.</p>
<p>The "blob" aesthetic of Kyoto Animation design captured in her small, huggable frame is also visible in <em>KOn</em>.</p>
<p>Maria Naganawa's voice acting skills are flawless. She never fails to exude Kanna’s curious, childlike nature.</p>
<p>Kyoto Animation's artistic identity shines in the adaptation, which is a great example of Kyoto Animation.</p>
<p>Because she barely spoke, she could have been boring and become a cute, but ultimately unoriginal, anime girl.</p>
<p>Kanna's body movements  speak volumes about her thanks to the outstanding and insightful editing, direction and animation.</p>
<p>You can watch <em>Kobayashi</em> if you feel down.</p>
<p>Simply put, Kanna is a pure ballof stoic <em>MOE</em> sunshine (or devastation, if she ever wants to return to her more draconic ways).</p>
<h3>Mizore Yoroizuka</h3>
<p><strong>Animation:</strong> Sound Euphonium</p>
<p>What is the point of playing an instrument?</p>
<p>It's usually because you love the sounds it makes.</p>
<p>Mizore Yoroizuka, an oboe player extraordinaire, is drawn to the beautiful memories music creates.</p>
<p>Mizore is a calm and unmoving girl.</p>
<p>Although she is good friends with the other girls in the concert group, she prefers to be by herself most of the day. She will even go to school early to practice her oboe.</p>
<p>Talking of friendship, the blue-haired singer captures the hearts of Kyoto Animation's audience as she and Nozomi Kazaki deal with the end of their friendship.</p>
<p>It is relatable, well-written, and heart-stirring.</p>
<p>If you find Mizori to already be a great supporting character in the series then you should definitely go see her as one the MCs of the instantly-classic film <em>Liz &amp; the Blue Bird</em>.</p>
<h3>Ouji Karasuma</h3>
<p><strong>Anime:</strong> Schools Rumble</p>
<p>Ouji Karasuma is the most stoic character of the series, even more than Yakumo. He has the look of a man who just wants to go home and fall asleep as soon as he enters the school grounds.</p>
<p>An earthquake doesn't make him scream, I think.</p>
<p>This is Ouji's beauty and charm.</p>
<p>Tenma is unabashedly in a relationship with him, but he rarely speaks or shows emotion.</p>
<p>His face is almost always the exact same so it's much more fun when he does something new, such as playing with the national soccer team and winning the championship or playing the electric guitar in a band.</p>
<p>Although he has some unusual hobbies and habits, they all make him more likeable than irritatingly strange.</p>
<p>Even though he has been gone for many years, I remember him as the stoic, stoic teenager who looked like a <em>Kappa</em> (a turtle-like creature in Japanese folklore).</p>
<p>Once you understand why he behaves the way he does it, you'll be a fan forever.</p>
<h3>Tanaka</h3>
<p><strong>Tanaka-kun:</strong> Tanaka_kun is Always Listeless</p>
<p>Tanaka reminds of Ouji Karasuma a lot.</p>
<p>Both have the same disinterested and unmotivated look in black eyes. They also often wear similar-looking school uniforms.</p>
<p>However, this doesn't mean Tanaka is just a carbon copy.</p>
<p>He's also the protagonist in the Silver Link series. I gave it a 10/10 after I watched the last episode.</p>
<p>The show's soothing color palette and crisp backgrounds (especially at the school), Tanaka's calm and serene personality makes it easier to relax than to withdraw emotionally while watching.</p>
<p>It would be hard to believe that a MC who only wants to sleep would work. But Tanaka is a complement to the characters and helps maintain the social dynamics of the series.</p>
<p>He isn't ideal, but he's admittedly a good-looking man. That's great.</p>
<p>Tanaka's diverse actions and responses might show that he is surprisingly kind, wise, and understanding.</p>
<p>On other occasions, however, you may see him as self-interested or apathetic.</p>
<p> Tanaka has a lot of potential to grow as a person and friend, while still maintaining his trademark listless look.</p>
<h3>Rei Ayanami</h3>
<p><strong>Anime:</strong> Neon Genesis Evangelion</p>
<p>Asuka Langley Sohryu created the <em>tsundere</em> archetype for ever, so was Hideaki Anno’s other main girl. She was also a catalyst for the <em>kuudere</em> type.</p>
<p>Rei Ayanami is barely present and important at the beginning of the 1995 series. This is compared to Asuka, who is vibrant and troubled, and Shinji, who suffers from crippling loneliness and confusion with himself and the world around.</p>
<p>She offers a glimpse into her mind as Shinji and other cast members interact with her.</p>
<p>Rei's personality balances her unmistakable mystery with the everyday pains and doldrums that come along with human life, from the almost empty apartment to her rare moments of sadness being visible,</p>
<p>Then came <em>the End of Evangelion</em>.</p>
<p>This film increases Rei Ayanami’s importance and exposure by <strong>unparalleled proportions</strong>.</p>
<p>To truly understand the film, you will only need to see it.</p>
<p>The apocalyptic climax felt simultaneously haunting, transcendent and ultimately humane to me -- and Rei was right there.</p>
